# Dirtr

## Abstract
  - Dirtr is an application which simulates users, allows you to take control of a user account, and utilize an app to find/favorite offroading trails in Colorado. This project is our final group project at Turing, working alongside backenders to make a truly from-scratch full-stack app. This is purely the Front End repo.

- User can view all trails, as well as trails already on their favorites
- User can add and remove any trail from their favorites list

## Possible Future Extensions
- Incorporate React Native
- Include ability to make a new account

### Learning Goals
- Work on a fullstack team
- Learn from the Back End: what do they handle? What info do they need from us? What info do we need from them?
- Independently learn and integrate Redux into the app
